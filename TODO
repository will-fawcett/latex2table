Thoughts on things to add:
------------------------
Improve on _where_ the script is run, so that *aux and *out files don't cause clutter. Perhaps /tmp? 


Proper option parsing, and add the following options:
-o: specify the output path
-i: specifiy the input
-h: help
-v: a verbose mode
-png: create a png of the table as well as the pdf (or just make a png?)
